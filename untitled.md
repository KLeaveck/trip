About me:   
Years ago, while in college, I got my start laying sod 10-12 hours a day. By my third summer I was a Foreman leading an entire crew and also held the top sales position for the company. I am no stranger to hard work. About two years ago I decided to go full time into web development. I brought with me that same drive and dedication that allowed me to grow not only in landscaping, but the small frontend web design company that I created in the interim. I thoroughly enjoy working  with colleagues, to reach our goals and the project conclusion.
